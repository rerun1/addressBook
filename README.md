#### _**by Suzi Rubino â€” September 4th, 2019**_

## Description
Web with program that builds an Address Book from user input and displays the first and last name, with more information displayed on click.

Add functionality to record and display a contact's email address.
Add functionality to record and display a contact's physical address.
Then, add functionality that allows a user to record multiple addresses (email or physical) for a single Contact. Address and Email are separate objects pushed into the contact object.
Program removes additional address and email fields when the form is submitted.

TO DO:
Describe the type of additional email or address ("work", "personal").
Refactor some of the other sections of the jQuery into functions as we did with resetFields()
Try a jQuery method from either the CSS or Effects options in the documentation (e.g. fadeIn() or css())
Try a jQuery method from the Events options (e.g. hover() or keypress())
Add support for multiple AddressBooks, each with their own unique set of Contacts. (For instance, you could have School, Personal, and Work address books to organize different types of friends, co-workers, and acquaintances.)
