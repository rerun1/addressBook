#### Address Book
#### _**by Suzi Rubino â€” September 4th, 2019**_
<br>

## Description
Web with program that builds a Address Book from user input and displays the first and last name, with more information displayed on click.

Add functionality to record and display a contact's email address.
Add functionality to record and display a contact's physical address.
Then, add functionality that allows a user to record multiple addresses (email or physical) for a single Contact, and what type each address is (ie: "work", "personal", etc.) (Hint: Address will need to be an object with multiple properties saved within the Contact object.)
Remove any additional address fields when the form is submitted. (One way to do this would be to use the not() and remove() functions.)
If you wish, work on these too:

Refactor some of the other sections of the jQuery into functions as we did with resetFields()
Try a jQuery method from either the CSS or Effects options in the documentation (e.g. fadeIn() or css())
Try a jQuery method from the Events options (e.g. hover() or keypress())
Add support for multiple AddressBooks, each with their own unique set of Contacts. (For instance, you could have School, Personal, and Work address books to organize different types of friends, co-workers, and acquaintances.)

## Objectives
- [] JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
- [] Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
- [] Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
- [] Application implements a for loop and works as expected.
All previous objectives have been met.
- [] Project is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
- [] Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
- [] Practice styling with imagery
